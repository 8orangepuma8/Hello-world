# Hello-world
The beginnings always the hardest. Lets see if I'm up to the task!

What's up y'all, so im new tao all this shit and im a really good self learner maybe not the best but i can fend for myself in most situations except this situation. so with my free time I am going to try and teach myself how to code up a web page or pages just to get a little bit of a grip on this here situation and then see where it can take me.
